# Production Deployment Notes

This document contains important notes for deploying the user-based authentication system to production.

## Current Implementation

The current authentication implementation has been modified to work in development without requiring MongoDB transactions. This was necessary because:

1. Prisma's standard approach requires transactions for session management
2. MongoDB transactions require a replica set configuration
3. Most development MongoDB instances run in standalone mode

## Changes Needed for Production

Before deploying to production, consider implementing one of these approaches:

### Option 1: Configure MongoDB as a Replica Set (Recommended)

This is the most robust approach and allows using Prisma's standard transaction capabilities:

1. Set up MongoDB as a replica set (even with a single node for small deployments)
2. Modify the authentication service to use the AdminSession model as originally intended
3. Implement proper session management with database persistence

### Option 2: Use an External Session Store

If you prefer not to configure MongoDB as a replica set:

1. Implement a Redis-based session store
2. Modify the authentication service to store sessions in Redis
3. Update session verification and management to use Redis

### Option 3: Keep the In-Memory Approach with Enhancements

For simple deployments, the current approach can be enhanced:

1. Replace the in-memory Map with a more robust solution that works across server instances
2. Add proper security controls and session validation
3. Implement session cleanup to prevent memory leaks

## Security Considerations

Regardless of the approach chosen, ensure:

1. **Password Security**: Implement proper password hashing and verification with bcrypt or similar
2. **HTTPS**: Ensure all authentication traffic is encrypted
3. **Cookie Security**: Set proper security flags on cookies (httpOnly, secure, sameSite)
4. **CSRF Protection**: Implement CSRF tokens for form submissions
5. **Rate Limiting**: Add rate limiting to prevent brute force attacks

## Implementation TODOs

1. Improve password verification:
```javascript
// Add this to the dependencies
// npm install bcrypt
// npm install @types/bcrypt --save-dev

import bcrypt from 'bcrypt';

// Replace the current authentication check with
const passwordValid = await bcrypt.compare(password, user.hashedPassword);
if (!passwordValid) {
  return { authenticated: false };
}
```

2. Add proper session management based on the chosen approach

3. Improve error handling and logging

4. Add CSRF protection to authentication endpoints

5. Implement proper role-based access control for different admin functions

## Testing Before Production

Before deploying to production:

1. Test all authentication flows
2. Verify that sessions expire correctly
3. Test concurrent logins and session management
4. Perform security testing including brute force attempts
5. Verify logging and monitoring

## Monitoring in Production

When deployed to production, monitor:

1. Failed login attempts
2. Session usage patterns
3. Database performance
4. Any unexpected errors or behaviors
