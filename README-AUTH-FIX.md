# Authentication Fix Instructions

This document contains steps to resolve the authentication issue where the system cannot find users in the MongoDB database.

## The Issue

The problem is that Prisma is not finding any users in the database because:

1. The Prisma schema was not correctly mapped to your actual MongoDB collection structure
2. We needed to:
   - Add the `@@map("users")` directive to the User model to tell Prisma which collection to use
   - Make some fields optional with `?` since your MongoDB schema might be slightly different

## Fix Steps

### 1. Pull the Latest Changes

```bash
git pull origin user-based-admin-auth
```

### 2. Run the Prisma Regeneration Script

The schema changes won't take effect until Prisma regenerates its client:

```bash
npm run prisma:regen
```

This script will:
- Clean the Prisma cache 
- Regenerate the Prisma client with the updated schema

### 3. Restart the Development Server

```bash
npm run dev
```

### 4. Try Logging In Again

You should now be able to log in with your credentials.

## Detailed Technical Explanation

The core issue was that Prisma was looking for users in a collection that either didn't exist or had a different name than expected. We've added the `@@map("users")` directive to the User model in the Prisma schema to explicitly tell Prisma which collection to use.

Additionally, we've made some fields optional (by adding `?` to their types) to handle potential schema differences between what Prisma expects and what's in your actual MongoDB collection.

If you're still experiencing issues, check:

1. That your MongoDB connection string (`MONGODB_URI`) in `.env.local` is correct:
   ```
   MONGODB_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/subscriptions
   ```

2. That your MongoDB database actually has a collection called `users` with a document that has your email address.

3. The console logs for more detailed error information.

## Final Note

This issue highlights the importance of having Prisma schemas that exactly match your database structure. If you make changes to your database schema in the future, remember to update the Prisma schema accordingly and regenerate the client.
