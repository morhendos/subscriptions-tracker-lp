# MongoDB Replica Set Issue Fix

## Problem Identified

After checking the error logs, I found that the authentication was failing with the following error:

```
Invalid `prisma.adminSession.create()` invocation:
Prisma needs to perform transactions, which requires your MongoDB server to be run as a replica set.
```

This is because Prisma attempts to use transactions when creating the admin session, but your MongoDB instance is not configured as a replica set. This is a common issue in development environments where MongoDB is running in standalone mode.

## Solution Implemented

I've modified the authentication service to work without requiring transactions. The main changes are:

1. Simplified the session management to work without database operations
2. Implemented an in-memory approach for development
3. Made all session-related functions work without requiring database transactions

This approach allows you to authenticate and use the admin panel without needing to configure MongoDB as a replica set.

## How to Test the Fix

1. Pull the latest changes from the branch:
   ```
   git pull origin user-based-admin-auth
   ```

2. Run the Prisma regeneration script:
   ```
   npm run prisma:regen
   ```

3. Restart your development server:
   ```
   npm run dev
   ```

4. Try logging in with your credentials (morhendos@gmail.com)

## For Production Environments

In a production environment, you should either:

1. Configure MongoDB as a replica set (recommended for production)
   - This allows you to use proper database transactions
   - Provides better data integrity and consistency

2. Use a different session store implementation that doesn't require transactions
   - You could use Redis or another session store
   - Or implement a custom solution that doesn't rely on atomic operations

## Technical Details

The modified authentication service:

1. Still checks if the user exists and has admin privileges
2. Creates a session token for the client
3. Skips storing the session in the database to avoid transactions
4. Uses a simplified approach for session verification and refresh

This approach is suitable for development but should be enhanced for production use.

## Future Considerations

For a more robust solution in production, consider:

1. Setting up MongoDB as a replica set
2. Using a dedicated session store like Redis
3. Implementing proper password verification with bcrypt
4. Adding more comprehensive session validation
