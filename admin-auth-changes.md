# Admin Authentication Improvements

This PR improves the admin authentication functionality to work better in serverless environments and adds better fallback mechanisms.

## Key Changes

### 1. Enhanced Session Management

- Improved the session handling in serverless environments by using a multi-layer authentication approach:
  - Primary: HTTP-only cookies for session management
  - Fallback: localStorage token for client-side authentication
  - API Key header support for programmatic access

### 2. Better Client-Side Auth Flow

- Fixed issues with the admin layout's authentication check
- The admin panel now correctly uses the localStorage fallback when needed
- Added automatic session creation from API key authentication
- Added proper clean up of localStorage on logout

### 3. Improved Login Experience

- Added initial auth check to prevent unnecessary login steps
- Added better error handling and user feedback
- Added development mode hints for easier testing
- Improved security by clearing invalid tokens

### 4. Auth API Enhancements

- Added multiple authentication methods in order of security preference
- Improved session handling with automatic renewal
- Better error handling and reporting

## Technical Implementation

- The session is primarily managed via HTTP-only cookies for security
- For environments where session cookies might not persist (like serverless functions with cold starts), we use a localStorage API key as fallback
- When using the API key fallback, the system will automatically create a proper session cookie when possible

## Testing

You can test the authentication by:

1. Logging in with the admin password
2. Refreshing the page to verify session persistence
3. Clearing cookies but keeping localStorage to test the fallback
4. Testing full logout to ensure both cookies and localStorage are cleared
