# Admin Authentication Improvements

This PR replaces the API key-based admin authentication with a secure user-based authentication system that integrates with the main application's user database.

## Key Changes

### 1. Secure User-Based Authentication

- Removed the hard-coded admin password/API key approach
- Added proper user authentication that requires an admin role from the main application
- Added secure session management with HTTP-only cookies
- Added server-side middleware to protect all admin routes

### 2. Database Integration

- Added Prisma schema for User and AdminSession models
- Integrated with the existing User model from the main application
- Added secure, persistent session management

### 3. UI Improvements

- Redesigned login page with proper email/password form
- Added user information display in the admin header
- Improved error handling and user feedback
- Added proper loading states and session checks

### 4. Security Enhancements

- Middleware secures all admin routes against unauthorized access
- Sessions expire after 24 hours and require re-authentication
- Passwords are never stored in localStorage or cookies
- Uses proper HTTP-only cookies for session management

## Implementation Details

### Authentication Flow

1. User visits `/admin` route
2. Middleware checks for a valid session
3. If no valid session exists, user is redirected to `/admin/login`
4. User enters their email and password from the main application
5. System verifies credentials and checks for admin role
6. If authenticated, a secure session is created and user is redirected to admin dashboard

### Admin Role Check

The authentication system checks for users with the 'admin' or 'super-admin' role in the main application's user database.

### Session Management

- Sessions are stored in the database
- Each session has a unique token and expiration time
- Sessions automatically refresh with usage
- Sessions can be explicitly invalidated on logout

## Testing

To test the authentication:

1. Use credentials from a user in the main application that has the admin role
2. Verify that users without admin role cannot access the admin panel
3. Verify that invalid credentials are rejected
4. Test session persistence across page refreshes
5. Test session expiration and automatic logout

## Future Improvements

- Add password reset functionality
- Add more granular role-based access controls
- Add two-factor authentication for admin users
- Add audit logging for admin actions
