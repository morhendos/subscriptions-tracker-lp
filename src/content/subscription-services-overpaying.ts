    <h3>Common Pitfalls:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Content Overlap:</strong> Keeping multiple services with similar content libraries</li>
      <li><strong>Unused Premium Features:</strong> Paying for premium tiers without utilizing premium features</li>
      <li><strong>Missed Opportunities:</strong> Not taking advantage of bundle deals</li>
    </ul>
  </div>

  <h2>2. Cloud Storage</h2>
  <p>Users frequently maintain multiple cloud storage subscriptions or pay for more storage than they need. By consolidating services and regularly reviewing usage, savings of $50-100 per year are possible.</p>

  <div class="tip">

  <h2>3. Digital News Subscriptions</h2>
  <p>While staying informed is important, subscribing to multiple news outlets with paywalls can quickly add up. Consider using aggregator services or looking for bundle deals through your employer or educational institution.</p>

  <h2>4. Productivity Apps</h2>
  <p>Many users pay for individual app subscriptions when a suite package would be more cost-effective. Additionally, free alternatives often provide similar functionality for basic needs.</p>

  <h2>5. Gaming Services</h2>
  <p>Multiple gaming subscription services often go underutilized. Our data shows that most users only actively play games on one platform regularly.</p>

  <h2>6. Music Streaming</h2>
  <p>Family plans shared with actual family members can significantly reduce per-person costs. Additionally, student discounts often go unclaimed.</p>

  <div class="callout callout-warning">
    <strong>Important:</strong> Always review the terms and conditions of family plans to ensure compliance with service providers' policies.
  </div>

  <h2>7. Fitness Apps</h2>
  <p>Many users maintain subscriptions to multiple fitness apps with overlapping features. Consider choosing one comprehensive service that meets most of your needs.</p>

  <h2>8. Premium Software Licenses</h2>
  <p>Professional software subscriptions often include features that casual users don't need. Evaluate if a lower tier or alternative solution would suffice.</p>

  <h2>9. Security Services</h2>
  <p>Users frequently pay for multiple security services that provide redundant protection. A single, comprehensive security suite is often more cost-effective.</p>

  <h2>10. Premium Website Services</h2>
  <p>Domain renewals, hosting services, and website builders often auto-renew at higher rates. Regular audits and price comparisons can lead to significant savings.</p>
